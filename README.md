# Hardware-Final
i) I needed a design that could hold the button and joystick component in place, so I included a holder for each one. I used a placeholder model for the LED light and breadboard.

ii) The design of the controller is rounded to emulate a ghost. The flatness of the controller allows for users to place it on a table to use, similar to arcade machine with joysticks, since users would have 1 hand on the joystick and 1 hand on the button.
